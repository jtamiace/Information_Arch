				<h4>Deciding Top Navigation</h4>
				<p>One of the hardest decisions we had to make was the first of our decisions. We wanted to present a top navigation that was simpler than the current GSU site, but that wouldn't be too short as to hide information from users. In doing this, we decided that options like Campus Life, Giving, and Global Engagement weren't common enough to be taking up such valuable real estate on the page. Instead, we swapped these with an "Athletics" option, since GSU is a D-1 school with a popular sports program while still making these three options available on the Home page.To do this we needed to find a logical place to present our awkward top navigation options like Global Engagement and Giving. In the end, we were inspired by Northwestern's homepage  which used an Explore section for various types of informative links for different types of users like Student Life. We also liked Stanford's quick links section for common user concerns such as Work, Apply, Give, and Visit, and decided to include these as well. Thus, we  implemented Giving within a similar set of quick links on our page. 

				<h4>Deciding Secondary Layout</h4>
				<p>Also difficult was deciding how to create a quick flow and general layout for our users on secondary pages. Currently, the GSU site does a mediocre job helping to funnel users to their desired destination and site information by congesting the page with too much information without enough direction. We felt that making the navigation options for these secondary level pages into titles with contextual information and even sub-links would help users to quickly identify the category most related to them and eschew aimless searching and scrolling on the page. 

				<h4>Deciding Footer Content</h4>
				<p>One of the last decisions we encountered was while we were developing our footer. We wanted to provide users with a quick way to not only access the main navigation items provided at the very top of the page, but also useful links and contact information.Narrowing down which links would be the most useful was difficult. In the end, we felt offering common tools for users like Campus Map, the PAWs student login, library options, directories, and some information for parking would be practical shortcuts that could serve a broad user group, especially those unfamiliar with the campus.
